## Behind Entry
</font>

Entry was built by three students who couldn't find any solutions that would allow us take notes directly in our Visual Studio code, in an easy and intuitive manner, with all the features expected from a modern notetaking app. As a result, we decided to develop Entry for our bachelor project.
