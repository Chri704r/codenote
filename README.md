## Behind Entry


Entry was built by three students who couldn't find any good setup that would allow us to take notes directly in our code editor in an easy and intuitive manner, with all the features expected from a modern WYSIWG-notetaking app.

As a result, we decided to develop Entry for our bachelor project.
